# TCP API Integration

- The Bash script will downlaod the tcp server.js and pm2app.json in the sink path
- And changes the config to get custom TCP PM2 service

## Script work

- Fetches the system IP address to configure TCP service in the sink 
- Then restarts the sink service to apply the settings
